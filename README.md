# 🛒 Amazon Product Web Scraper – CodeAlpha Internship

This repository contains a Python-based **Web Scraping Tool** that extracts detailed product information from Amazon product pages.  
The project was created as part of my internship at **CodeAlpha** to demonstrate my ability to work with data extraction, HTML parsing, and data storage.


## 🚀 Internship Task Overview

As part of the **CodeAlpha Internship**, I was assigned to:

- Use Python libraries like `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`.
- Identify and extract relevant data from live web pages.
- Store and clean the extracted data using `pandas`.
- Create a custom dataset suitable for analysis or automation.
- Demonstrate the working script through a video and submit code on GitHub.
